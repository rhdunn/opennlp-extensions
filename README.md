# OpenNLP Extensions
This is a set of extensions for working with OpenNLP.
1. [opennlp-conll](src/opennlp-conll) is a collection of classes for working
   with CoNLL-X and CoNLL-U treebanks.
2. [opennlp-train](src/opennlp-train) is a collection of helper classes and
   functions for training different OpenNLP models.

These extensions provide several [Training Applications](src/opennlp-train/README.md#training-applications)
for creating the different OpenNLP model objects using the supported treebank
files and configuration properties.
